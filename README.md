# Distributed-Computing-Simulator
The purpose of this project is to create an environment to mimic could computing and distributed systems; in such an environment, networked computers share their resources such as storage and computational powers (CPU) to complete a task with higher efficacy and in minimum possible time.            

The objective is to design an application to distribute the calculation process among different clients so called Workers in order to decrease the time required for the process and avoid server bottleneck.
